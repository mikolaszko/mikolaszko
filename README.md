## Hi everyone 🦊

My name is Mikołaj Sodzawiczny and I am just a huge coding-nerd (like seriously, it's my biggest passion)

✨ I am a React Engineer at a Dutch start-up (going public soon!!!) and I would describe myself as a fairly curious person who loves to explore the vast world of technology! 
💻 I am currently doing a lot of complex projects to better myself as a software engineer and to explore technologies I can't use at work like Next.js, Solidity, Tailwind etc. 
⏩ In the future I'd love to learn Python and C#. 
🎲 I really enjoy video and board games, my favorite ones are Wingspan, Gloomshaven, Tranquality and Terraforming Mars. 
☕ I am also a coffee nerd and I could talk about different roast methods for hours

🥂 Cheers!
